# defeatcovid19-diagnosis-Apps
Here I have a prototypes of mobile app and web app and a Jupyter notebook for training bots on Covid19 dataset.

## AI_Training_for_covid19.jpynb
This is a simple notebook which includes some script wrtten by me. I will do required changes and train bots on it for below mentioned apps.

## COVID19_X_RAY_SCANNER_FLUTTER
This an app develop by flutter who uses TensorFlow Lite for image classification.
So my idea is to train model using jupyter notebook mentioned here and implement it here such that this app is used for classifying images into positive and negative X-Rays images for corona virus.

## COVID19_X_RAY_SCANNER2_FLUTTER
This an app develop by flutter who uses TensorFlow Lite for object detection.
So my idea is to train model using jupyter notebook mentioned here and implement it here such that this app is used to detect symbols in X-Rays images for corona virus.

Here I am using these alot of different apps because of which ever perform better I will go with it in further development.
